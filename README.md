The Video Upload and Playback API is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload video files, store them on the server, retrieve a list of uploaded videos, and play videos using unique video IDs.


## Overview

The Video Upload and Playback API provides the following features:

- **Upload Videos**: Users can upload video files, and each video is assigned a unique ID.

- **List Uploaded Videos**: Users can retrieve a list of successfully uploaded videos.

- **Play Videos**: Users can play uploaded videos by providing their unique video ID.

The API is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and it uses an SQLite database to store video metadata.
